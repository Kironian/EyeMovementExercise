# EyeMovementExercise

This exercise creates objects (eyes) that will follow the mouse around the screen.

// Description

This exercise serves to show my ability to use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a working mouse tracker, so that elements on the page, such as the eyeballs in the example, follow the mouse. I achieved this by using a JavaScript function that utilized onmousemove to reference the css/html div elements and animate them. 

// How To Run This script can be tested by downloading the .zip including the index, css, and js files. Once downloaded and unzipped, you may open the html file to test. As you move your mouse you should notice the eyes follow your ouse around the screen.

// Road Map of Improvements

In the future, I would love to add in more features to this face to further demonstraight my abilties, such as adding a mouth that could open or close depending on mouse location, or adding a function so that they eyes may blink when you "click"/press on the face.
